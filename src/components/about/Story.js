          Founded in 2021, our platform began with a simple idea: language
          learning should be conversational, authentic, and community-driven.
          Our founder, Sarah Johnson, experienced firsthand the challenges of
          learning a new language through traditional methods.

          After struggling to achieve fluency despite years of classroom study,
          she discovered that regular conversations with native speakers
          accelerated her learning exponentially. This revelation inspired the
          creation of our platform - a place where language learners could
          connect with native speakers and fellow students in a supportive,
          structured environment.

          Today, we&apos;ve grown to support over 50 languages and thousands of
          active learning groups worldwide. Our community spans six continents
          and continues to grow as more people discover the power of
          conversational language learning.
